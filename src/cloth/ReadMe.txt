ClothMesh can be a very CPU expensive Mesh to run
So take care when setting the Number of Points

For best performance Try keeping points to a maximum of 5k
{
    I run an i7 quad with 16gb ram 
    Nvidia geforce gtx 760 2gb graphics card 
}
I notice a performance drop around 9k points

ClothMesh is still under active development and performance increases.
